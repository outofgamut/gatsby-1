title: Gatsby for Freelancers
---

As a freelancer, the most important thing is [helping clients understand](/docs/winning-over-clients/) the benefits of Gatsby.

## First-class performance and SEO

Gatsby does static rendering, which makes content available as HTML, and search engine optimized. This also results in a much faster load time for the site.

## The flexibility to expand

Gatsby was built to be extensible and flexible — using plugins is one way to make it so. They can be directly installed and be used for a variety of functionality including making the site offline, adding Google analytics, adding support for inline SVGs, you name it — the list is almost endless.

Of the different types of Gatsby plugins, the gatsby-source plugins in particular fetch data from a local or remote source and allow it to be usable via GraphQL. These sources could be CMSs such as Wordpress, Drupal, Plone, local markdown, XML or such files, databases, APIs and data formats as JSON, CSV.

This implies that almost anything at all can be used as a source to work with Gatsby and generate static sites.

## Ease of customization

Using React components to build out the UI allows freelancers to have full-control over the look and feel of the site. Gone are the days of having to use CSS overrides to "bend" styles to your liking.

## Hosting flexibility

Not all freelancers are paid to maintain sites for their clients. With Gatsby, you have full control over a variety of build and deployment options.
